# Cowculator Roadmap
> Last updated: 2026-02-26

---

## Current Status

App is live, deployed to Vercel, and test links have been sent to early users.
Core features are complete. Next phase = monetization + marketing.

---

## Monetization Plan

### Pricing
- **Monthly:** $4.99/month
- **Annual:** $39.99/year (~save 33% vs monthly — push this hard)

### Launch Promo — Founding Member Deal
- **Price:** $19 one-time, lifetime access
- **Cap:** First 200–300 users only (real cap, not fake scarcity)
- **Why:** Creates urgency, rewards early believers, generates upfront cash while Stripe infra is new
- **After cap is hit:** Switch to normal $4.99/$39.99 pricing — the contrast makes it look like a deal

### Free Tier (what you get for free)
| Feature | Free |
|---------|------|
| Up to 3 debts | ✅ |
| Avalanche + Snowball strategies | ✅ |
| Payoff date projection | ✅ |
| Basic dashboard + progress ring | ✅ |
| Milestone tracker (basic) | ✅ |
| 2–3 default themes only | ✅ |
| Manual payment logging | ✅ |
| Paycheck logging (1 income source only) | ✅ |

### Pro Tier (everything unlocked)
| Feature | Pro |
|---------|-----|
| Unlimited debts | 🔒 |
| All 10 kawaii themes | 🔒 |
| Full budget planner (all income sources) | 🔒 |
| Asset tracking | 🔒 |
| Subscription tracker | 🔒 |
| Advanced charts (Interest vs Principal, Debt Over Time) | 🔒 |
| Payment history + streak tracking | 🔒 |
| Bill calendar + bill distribution panel | 🔒 |
| One-time funding / extra payment modeling | 🔒 |
| Data export (CSV/JSON) | 🔒 |
| Custom debt categories | 🔒 |
| Expense tracker | 🔒 |

### Key Insight — Free Gate Strategy
The 3-debt ceiling is the most important gate. Most people with real debt have more than 3.
They'll hit the wall fast, but only after they've already fallen in love with the app.
Themes behind Pro also works specifically for Cowculator — the kawaii aesthetic IS the brand.
People will pay to have Cinnamoroll.

### Conversion Benchmarks (from research)
- No free trial: ~2–5% free-to-paid conversion
- With 14-day Pro trial on signup: ~12% conversion
- Annual plan retention: 36% after year 1 vs ~7% for monthly

---

### Channel Playbooks

#### 1. TikTok / DebtTok — #1 Priority Channel
- #FinTok has 4.5B views. DebtTok is a real, active community.
- TikTok gives NEW accounts organic reach (unlike Instagram where you need followers).
- Cow-themed debt app = exactly what gets shared.

**Content ideas:**
- App walkthroughs ("Watch my debt free date change in real time 🐄")
- "Debt snowball vs avalanche — I ran the numbers" with screen recording
- Responding to debt questions with Cowculator as the answer
- Milestone celebrations with branded cow graphics

**Hashtags:** #DebtTok #FinTok #DebtFree #BudgetTok #DebtPayoff #PersonalFinance #Cowculator

**Cadence:** 3–5x per week. Cross-post everything to YouTube Shorts simultaneously.

---

#### 2. Reddit — Community Moat
Done right, Reddit becomes a self-sustaining army of people who recommend Cowculator forever.

**Target subreddits:**
| Subreddit | Members | Approach |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| r/personalfinance | ~19M | Value first, mention tool only when asked |
| r/debtfree | ~200K | Share milestones, builder story |
| r/povertyfinance | ~2.1M | Emphasize "free" heavily — loves free tools |
| r/SideProject | ~503K | Direct promotion ALLOWED |
| r/shamelessplug | ~52K | Direct promotion ALLOWED |
| r/InternetIsBeautiful | ~17M | Free web tools crush here |
| r/webdev / r/reactjs | varies | Technical builder story |

**The 9:1 Rule (mandatory):** For every 1 post mentioning Cowculator, post 9 things of pure value.

**Builder story format that works:**
> "I was drowning in debt and couldn't find a free tool that didn't want my credit card. So I built one. Here's what I learned about snowball vs. avalanche after tracking 6 months of payments..."

**What gets you banned:** Posting links without context, new account with no comment history, same post to multiple subs at once.

---

#### 3. Product Hunt — Launch Spike
Can get thousands of sign-ups in one day if done right. Cowculator's brand will stand out.

**30 days before launch:**
- Create PH account and START commenting/upvoting other products daily
- Reach out to indie makers to be your "hunter" (someone with PH followers)
- Build supporter list — friends, family, social followers who will upvote Day 1

**Launch day:**
- Post at 12:01 AM Pacific Time (full 24-hour window)
- First 3–6 hours decide your ranking — have supporters ready
- Respond to EVERY single comment
- Don't ask for upvotes directly ("check it out and share your thoughts" works)

**Tagline idea:** "The free debt payoff calculator that doesn't want your credit card 🐄"

---

#### 4. Hacker News — Show HN
**Title format:** `Show HN: Cowculator – free debt payoff tracker (snowball/avalanche, no account required)`

**What HN loves:** Open source, privacy-first, actually free, built by one person solving their own problem.

**Best time:** Tuesday–Thursday, 9–11 AM US Eastern.

---

#### 5. SEO — Long-Term Compound Engine

**Target keywords (low competition, high intent):**
- "debt snowball calculator"
- "debt avalanche calculator"
- "free debt tracker app no account"
- "debt payoff planner snowball vs avalanche"
- "best free debt payoff app 2026"
- "YNAB alternative free"
- "undebt.it alternative"
- "how long to pay off $X in debt"

**Content to create (priority order):**
1. Public calculator page — works WITHOUT signing up (SEO anchor, removes friction)
2. "Snowball vs. Avalanche: Which Pays Off Debt Faster?" — evergreen with embedded calc
3. "Best Free Debt Payoff Apps 2026" — include yourself + honest competitor comparison (builds trust)
4. "Free Debt Payoff Spreadsheet vs App" — targets huge spreadsheet-user audience

---

#### 6. Referral / Viral Mechanics (Build Into App)

**Shareable milestone cards** — When a user hits a milestone ("I just saved $1,200 in interest!"), auto-generate a branded card they can share. Cards say "Cowculator" with cow logo. People WILL post these on DebtTok and Reddit. **This is the #1 feature to build.**

**Feature unlock referral** — Refer a friend → unlock a premium cow theme or badge. Dropbox model.

**When to show the referral prompt:** After they see their debt-free date for the first time. That's the emotional high point.

---

#### 7. Low-Spend Paid Options ($20–50 budget)
**Recommendation: Put it all into Reddit Ads.**
- CPCs: $0.20–0.40 in finance subreddits (vs $2–5+ on Meta/Google)
- Daily minimum: $5–6/day
- $50 = ~10 days targeted in r/personalfinance, r/debtfree, r/povertyfinance

**Skip:** Google Ads (too expensive). Meta Ads (not worth it below $50/week).

## The Cowculator Brand Angle

The name is the biggest hidden advantage.
"Cowculator" is memorable, meme-able, and fun in a space full of boring finance apps.
Venmo, Cash App, Klarna all won with quirky branding in serious spaces.

**Use it everywhere:**
- "The free debt calculator that moos at your debt 🐄"
- Cow emoji in every post
- Cow-themed achievement badges
- Milestone cards with cow graphics
- "Your herd is debt free!" when a goal is hit

People will say "I used the Cowculator" on Reddit just because it's fun to say. That's free marketing.
